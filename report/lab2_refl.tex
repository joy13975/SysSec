% A reflective part, in which you critically reflect on the circumstances (both technical and organisational) that can give rise to the relevant vulnerabilities and potential mitigations. This can include e.g. mention of real instances of these attacks that you have researched, comparison to other attacks, discussion of relevant standards and recommendations (CERT, OWASP etc.). You can also discuss topics relating to the vulnerablities that you exploited, including: their potential risk and impact in real systems; why they (still) exist; which straightforward attempts at mitigation do not work and why not; how you would sucessfully reduce or eliminate these vulnerabilities.

%Is this exploit still relevant today and why/why not?
%Cite occurences that brought people's attention to the exploit

%Are there new problems relating to this exploit today?
%Cite potential risks to real systems and what can be done about it

%Introduce related vulnerabilities or variants for research points

%Finally, close with best practices to mitigate the vulnerability
%Explain a simple method that doesn't work perfectly
%Explain a standard way to eliminate/minimise the risk of the vulnerability
