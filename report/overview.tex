%One page intro/overview here explaining what this report contains, briefly describe procedures (SEED VM etc) and our conclusion
This coursework investigates two basic yet powerful exploits: the format strings exploit and the buffer overflow exploit. In both of the experiments, the SEED labs virtual machine is used. We target audiences who have at least some programming experience in C and a basic understanding about memory layouts. Required source code files should be found in \\

In each technical report, we first introduce the problem at hand by providing some background basics. Then, we illustrate why the mechanism breaks down in certain usages.
