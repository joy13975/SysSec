abstract = {Note: most of the vulnerabilities in this document have NOT been made public; they were discovered by rain.forest.puppy, or other members of WT. Lots of new toys out there on the Internet lately. Seems like the web is the way to go, and every software spigot is demanding they be 'web-enabled'. A lot are reinventing the wheel, bundling sub-standard web servers to serve up their HTML and Java interface. But this article isn't about them. There's too many, and they're to easy to use as vulnerable targets. It's much more fun to find the needle in the haystack, so I'm going to focus on some more common setups. On to the show.},
