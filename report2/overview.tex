%One page intro/overview here explaining what this report contains, briefly describe procedures (SEED VM etc) and our conclusion
This coursework demonstrates network vulnerabilities in each of the four Internet protocol suite layers: from  ARP spoofing (Link Layer) and ICMP redirect (Internet Layer) to TCP reset and hijack (Transport Layer) and SQL injection (Applcation Layer). Multiple SEED labs virtual machines were used to form a small offline network in our experiments. This report assumes that the reader knows how to use basic Linux commands and some php coding. All source codes referred to in this report are available in the viritual machine image itself.

In each technical section, the vulnerabilities are first introduced by prodiving the respective context. We then craft attacks to break each of the four networking mechanisms, and discuss modern approaches to defend against these attacks. Finally, we brief background review is given.
