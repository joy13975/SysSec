%One page intro/overview here explaining what this report contains, briefly describe procedures (SEED VM etc) and our conclusion
This coursework investigates two basic yet powerful vulnerabilities: format strings and buffer over- flow. In the upcoming experiments, the SEED labs virtual machine is used. We target audiences who have some programming experience in C and a basic understanding about memory layouts. Required source code files should be found in \\

In each technical report, we first introduce the problem at hand by providing the context. Then, we illustrate how the respective mechanisms break down in under certain circumstances. We proceed to exploit these vulnerabilities and finally, reflect on the bigger picture.
